**KOTLIN -**

Interviewer - Why kotlin over java ?

You  - We have may adavantages of using Kotlin over java as - 
         1. Readability - Comparing to Java, Kotlin has more readable and precise code which 
                          **makes** it easier to understand the program.	
         
         2. Null-Safe   - Null pointer exceptions also referred to as “The billion-dollar mistake”, 
		 				  is one of the most common errors that cause apps to crash if you are using Java.
         
         3. Immutability- An immutable object is an object whose state cannot be changed once it is created.
                          In Kotlin variables are defined using val or var to help developers 
						  easily understand which values can be reassigned.
